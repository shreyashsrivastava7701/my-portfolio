    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello and thank you for visiting my Digital Portfolio.

      I was born and raised in India. I enjoy coding, reading, and problem solving. In coding, I have great interest in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Python. 
      As I see the need for a revolution, my mission is to work for the future and sustainability of our world. 
      Computers, mathematics, and science are my favourite subjects. 
      Through this website, I hope to showcase some of my past work and experiences that demonstrate my skills and interests in various fields.
